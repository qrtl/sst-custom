This module adds delivered amount fields the customer invoice.

We regard service lines and credit notes as "delivered."

Background:

There are cases where user issues an invoice to the customer upfront in a business transaction,
just for the sake of convenience, even when the goods are yet to be delivered to them.
In such case, technically speaking, revenue should not be recognized until the delivery is done.

This module intends to make the "real" sales amount visible in the invoice views by computing
the delivered amount.
