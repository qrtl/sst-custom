This module limits the visibility of the 'technical_features' attribute
in the preference view, making it accessible exclusively to internal users.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

To enhance security, non-internal users' backend access, which includes their ability
to view 'technical_features' and related menu items, should be restricted to uphold the
intended user access levels.
