This module limits the visibility of the 'technical_features' attribute
in the preference view, making it accessible exclusively to internal
users.

## Background

To enhance security, non-internal users' backend access, which includes
their ability to view 'technical_features' and related menu items,
should be restricted to uphold the intended user access levels.
